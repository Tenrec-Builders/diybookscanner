# Website for diybookscanner.org

These are the source files for the [diybookscanner.org](http://diybookscanner.org) website. They are built around Mustache templates which allows the whole thing to be translated into multiple languages fairly easily.

- `out/` is the resulting HTML files, along with the static CSS files and images
- `src/` contains the the YAML content files to build the site in different languages
- `template/` has the HTML Mustache templates for each page

If you would like to volunteer to help translate or if you see a bug, email diybookscanner@gmail.com.
