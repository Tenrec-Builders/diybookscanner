<p>You should also take a look at Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/linear-book-scanner/">linear book scanner</a> as a possible solution.</p>

  No. These large organizations have limited resources which they will devote to their own priorities. If you want a digital copy of your great aunt's recipe book, scanning it is up to you.

  We don't know. Some books are in the public domain or are personal documents. Others are copyrighted and fair use laws differ from country to country. You alone are responsible for learning and observing the laws in your jurisdiction.

	<h1>What cameras should I use?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
  The current camera recommendation is Canon PowerShot ELPH 160. These are 20MP cameras which work with <a href="http://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scan">Pi Scan</a> and are still being manufactured.
</p>
<p>
  But any camera which work with your budget and your rig is just as good. For a more complete discussion of what properties you should look for in a prospective camera, read the 'Picking Cameras' section of the <a href="intro.html">Getting Started page</a>.

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>While you can use whatever you want, consider that it might not be a good idea to use such cameras. Although phone cameras are getting better every day, they still lack much of the control that we can get from CHDK-enabled compacts. Most do not support a remote control protocol like PTP.</p>

	<h1>Do I really need two cameras?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>The main advantage of using a single camera is avoiding the expense of purchasing two cameras. Another reason to consider using a single camera is that you have a lot more options when controlling the camera. Many cameras have remote capture software or accessories out of the box.</p>
<p>Though these advantages are sometimes compelling, we recommend that you scan with two cameras in most cases. While it is possible to set up a rig that uses just one camera, it is usually not a good trade-off.</p>
<p>One kind of single-camera setup has the camera taking a picture of one page at a time. The downside of this is that you are scanning at half the speed. To scan a whole book, you must flip through the pages once for every odd page. Then you have to turn the book around and flip through the pages once for every even page. Afterwards, the images you have taken are not ordered properly and so must be collated during post-processing.</p>
<p>Another kind of single-camera rig has a single camera capture both pages of a book at once. The problem here is that this only works if you hold the book flat on a table which means that you are causing a lot of wear and tear on the spine. In addition, there will be unavoidable page curl in the resulting images, especially near the gutter. While there are algorithmic techniques for dewarping the page after capture, these techniques only work on some pages and tend to be unreliable.</p>

  When scanning books over 400mm tall or 350mm wide, special techniques are required. There is no cut and dried solution yet, but several forum threads explore possible answers. See <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=3240">here</a> and <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2976">here</a> for some ideas.

  Not everyone wants to spend years designing a book scanner or months building one. If you want to get started scanning on your own right away, you might find that <a href="http://store.diybookscanner.org">buying a kit</a> is the best option.
