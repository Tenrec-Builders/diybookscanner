    title: What is a Book Scanner?
    text: "A book scanner is any device used to digitize the pages of a book. Every book scanner has three parts. Cameras are used to capture images of each page. A controller triggers the cameras and saves the resulting photographs somewhere convenient. The scanner rig provides an ideal photographic environment while holding everything together."

  title: Book Scanner Rigs
  text: "Book scanners can be as simple as a cardboard box rig, a camera on a tripod, and your hand as the controller. Or they can have multiple moving parts with computer-controlled capture and high resolution cameras. Here is how a typical scanning rig comes together:"

index-body:
  -
    title: Lighting
    text: Though some scanners rely on ambient room lighting, dedicated lighting is important to capture good scans. You want the lights to be strong and even. The lights must also be positioned to minimize glare and reflections.
  -
    title: Cameras
    text: Each camera must be mounted securely and aligned to point directly at the center of the page it is scanning. If possible, you want two cameras so you can capture both pages at the same time.
  -
    title: Platen
    text: The easiest way to avoid page curl in your images is to flatten the pages by pressing them against glass or acrylic. While there are some computer algorithms that can help dewarp the pages after capture, it is always more reliable to just capture flat pages in the first place.
  -
    title: Book
    text: The book lies at the center of any scanning rig. It is alternately pressed against the platen for scanning and then pulled away so that the page can be flipped.
  -
    title: Cradle
    text: The cradle supports the back and spine of the book. While any contact with a book will cause wear and tear, a V-shaped cradle can minimize the wear that scanning can cause.

    question: Why not just cut the binding off and use a feed scanner?
    answer: |
      <p>This is almost certainly the fastest way to scan a book. While many in the community prefer more gentle methods, others share tips and techniques for <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=30">destructive scanning</a> here.</p>

  -
    question: What about a completely automated scanner?
    answer: |
      <p>
        This is an area of active research. A few people have come up with impressive looking prototypes.

      <p>You should also take a look at Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/linear-book-scanner/">linear book scanner</a> as a possible solution.</p>
      <p>
        If you have more ideas about how to solve this difficult problem or want to show off your own design, please post it in the forum.
      </p>

  -
    question: Can't we just leave it to Google and the Internet Archive?
    answer: |
      <p>
        No. These large organizations have limited resources which they will devote to their own priorities. If you want a digital copy of your great aunt's recipe book, scanning it is up to you.
      </p>

  -
    question: Am I legally allowed to scan my books?
    answer: |
      <p>
        We don't know. Some books are in the public domain or are personal documents. Others are copyrighted and fair use laws differ from country to country. You alone are responsible for learning and observing the laws in your jurisdiction.
      </p>

  -
    question: What cameras should I use?
    answer: |
      <p>
        The current camera recommendation is Canon PowerShot ELPH 160. These are 20MP cameras which work with <a href="http://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scan">Pi Scan</a> and are still being manufactured.
      </p>
      <p>
        But any camera which work with your budget and your rig is just as good. For a more complete discussion of what properties you should look for in a prospective camera, read the 'Picking Cameras' section of the <a href="intro.html">Getting Started page</a>.
      </p>

  -
    question: Can I use my phone camera or a webcam?
    answer: |
      <p>While you can use whatever you want, consider that it might not be a good idea to use such cameras. Although phone cameras are getting better every day, they still lack much of the control that we can get from CHDK-enabled compacts. Most do not support a remote control protocol like PTP.</p>

  -
    question: Do I really need two cameras?
    answer: |
      <p>The main advantage of using a single camera is avoiding the expense of purchasing two cameras. Another reason to consider using a single camera is that you have a lot more options when controlling the camera. Many cameras have remote capture software or accessories out of the box.</p>
      <p>Though these advantages are sometimes compelling, we recommend that you scan with two cameras in most cases. While it is possible to set up a rig that uses just one camera, it is usually not a good trade-off.</p>
      <p>One kind of single-camera setup has the camera taking a picture of one page at a time. The downside of this is that you are scanning at half the speed. To scan a whole book, you must flip through the pages once for every odd page. Then you have to turn the book around and flip through the pages once for every even page. Afterwards, the images you have taken are not ordered properly and so must be collated during post-processing.</p>
      <p>Another kind of single-camera rig has a single camera capture both pages of a book at once. The problem here is that this only works if you hold the book flat on a table which means that you are causing a lot of wear and tear on the spine. In addition, there will be unavoidable page curl in the resulting images, especially near the gutter. While there are algorithmic techniques for dewarping the page after capture, these techniques only work on some pages and tend to be unreliable.</p>

  -
    question: I want to scan very large books
    answer: |
      <p>
        When scanning books over 400mm tall or 350mm wide, special techniques are required. There is no cut and dried solution yet, but several forum threads explore possible answers. See <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=3240">here</a> and <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2976">here</a> for some ideas.
      </p>

  -
    question: I'm a klutz. Can I still make a book scanner?
    answer: |
      <p>
        Not everyone wants to spend years designing a book scanner or months building one. If you want to get started scanning on your own right away, you might find that <a href="http://store.diybookscanner.org">buying a kit</a> is the best option.

    title: Picking Cameras
    text: |
      <p>There are a wide variety of cameras that you can scan with. If you plan on using <a href="http://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scan">Pi Scan</a> to control your cameras, then you should use Canon PowerShot ELPH 160 cameras. But if you are using some other setup, then here are some general guidelines for choosing cameras.</p>
      <p>Selecting the right camera is really important. We have years and years of debate on the topic. No question gets asked more often, and so nobody has thought about this more than the DIY book scanning community. And we have a three step process for you to figure it out.</p>
      <h2>Step 1. How many megapixels do you need?</h2>
      <p>A. Measure at the books you intend to scan. Aim for the largest average size (don't choose the largest outliers). For example, most textbooks are around 9 x 11in (22.86cm x  27.94cm).  </p>
      <p>B. Now multiply that size by the PPI (pixels per inch) that you intend to capture. 300 is a safe minimum, though you can't go wrong by capturing higher than that. So, in our example - 9*300=2700. 11*300=3300. We need an image that's at least 2700x3300 = 8910000 pixels, or about 9 megapixels. Now, that's if you used every pixel perfectly to capture every part of the page, which NEVER happens. So to be safe, add 20-30% for wasted pixels. In this case, that makes 12 megapixels the minimum to get at least 300PPI capture.</p>
      <h2>Step 2. How much control do you need?</h2>
      <p>If you're just scanning one book, or you're scanning a book for it's information content only (as opposed to trying to capture the actual physical appearance of the book), you don't need very good captures. If the lighting changes, or the camera settings change from shot-to-shot, you’ll still get some kind of result. However, the more perfectly you want to capture the book, and the more pages you want to capture, the more control you need. So assuming you want to do a good job and care about more than just the raw text on any page, you need a camera that lets you control the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Shutter speed</li>
        <li>White balance</li>
        <li>Aperture</li>
        <li>ISO</li>
        <li>Flash on/off</li>
        <li>Any custom image processing (sharpenng, color enhancements, etc)</li>
        <li>Focus (ideally being able to lock focus)</li>
        <li>Exposure compensation</li>
        <li>Zoom</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Most DSLRs allow for all this kind of control; for compact cameras only Canon Powershot cameras that are capable of running <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com">CHDK</a> give you control over all these parameters. To see if a camera is capable of running CHDK, you can <a href="http://www.mighty-hoernsche.de/">check here</a>.</p>
      <p>One more factor to consider: ideally you want to run the cameras from an AC adapter instead of batteries. Check availability of these accessories.</p>
      <h2>Step 3. How much money do you have?</h2>
      <p>If you have a healthy budget, just buy DSLR cameras and use those. Buy the highest resolution you can afford, and try the “kit lens” that comes with the camera body as a starting place (they usually cost only $50-100 over the price of the camera body alone and perform reasonably well).</p>
      <p>If you're on a budget, the aforementioned Canon compact cameras can often be purchased for as little as $75 USD each, and, with CHDK, produce incredibly high-quality images. They are by far the best “bang for the buck” - which is what DIY Scanning is all about.</p>

    title: CHDK and Canon Cameras
    text: |
      <p>Most cheap compact cameras do not have a software interface. They can be controlled only by manual or mechanical triggering. But a team of volunteers has developed software which can allow Canon compact cameras to be controlled and configured remotely. This software is called <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com">CHDK</a>.</p>
      <p>CHDK is loaded onto an SD card which is then inserted into the camera. When the camera starts up, CHDK is run automatically. Since CHDK never makes any permanent changes to the camera, you can always just remove the special CHDK SD card to run the camera normally.</p>
      <p>CHDK is an essential pre-requisite to the software controllers listed below. The controllers run on a PC or Raspberry Pi and communicate with the CHDK software running on the cameras over USB. CHDK provides many enhanced capabilities, including the ability to configure the camera over USB, capture photographs, and then transfer the resulting images over USB to the controller.</p>
      <p>Because CHDK is so useful and there is no equivalent for other kinds of cheap point and shoot cameras, most users in the forums use Canon cameras in their rigs. When using other kinds of cheap cameras, the only control option is some kind of mechanical or manual triggering.</p>

    title: Controlling the Cameras
    intro: The first task when digitizing books is capturing an image of each page and then putting those images in a convenient place. There are a few ways you can go about this task.

        title: Pi Scan
        url: "http://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scan"
        text: |
          <p>Pi Scan is a scanning appliance which runs on a Raspberry Pi 2. It supports Canon PowerShot A2500 and Canon PowerShot ELPH 160 cameras. You plug your cameras into it along with a monitor, mouse, optional keyboard, and an external disk. It configures and triggers both cameras, saving the images to external storage. When you are done, your external disk will have a folder full of image scans.</p>

        title: Spreads
        url: "http://www.diybookscanner.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=35"
        text: |
          <p>Spreads can also run on a Raspberry Pi, though it works on many flavors of Linux as well. It works with many CHDK-compatible cameras. You control Spreads over the network via a web interface. It configures and controls the cameras and keeps them in named 'Workflows'. When a workflow is complete, you can download a compressed archive of the images or save them onto an external drive.</p>

        title: TwoCamControl
        url: "http://www.diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3082"
        text: |
          <p>If you have a Windows machine, you can run the TwoCamControl script directly on your PC. It works with many CHDK-compatible cameras. This means that you don't have to buy any extra hardware or worry about interfacing with it. Just specify a directory and the images will be saved there.</p>

      -
        title: Mechanical Trigger
        url: "http://diybookscanner.org/forum/search.php?keywords=bicycle+brake"
        text: |
          <p>If none of the software options works for you, there is still hope for an ergonomic solution. You just need a way to replicate a finger pushing against the shutter button on your camera. The most common way to do this is by repurposing bicycle brake systems. Bicycle brakes work by pneumatic pressure. When you squeeze the lever, it increases the pressure in a tube. This pressure can be used to push a piston positioned directly over the shutter button of a camera.</p>
          <p>After capturing images using a mechanical trigger, you will still need to copy the images off of the cameras and onto your computer for post-processing. If possible, use a data cable to do this. Otherwise you may have to unmount your cameras to get access to the physical cards inside.</p>

      -
        title: Manual Trigger
